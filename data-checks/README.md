# Data checks

The aim of the data checks is to support the development and quality assurance of the hseclean code. The code produces exploratory graphs and checks key validation criteria to check the data is processed correctly. The data checks conducted are used to produce a brief data validation report.   

The code can also be a basis for project specific code development e.g. take a copy of it to build the inputs for a particular modelling project.
