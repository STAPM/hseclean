#' These are the expected volumes (ml) of different beverage containers / serving sizes.

#' spirits (serving 25ml),
#' sherry (serving 50ml), wine (small glass 125ml, standard glass 175ml, large glass 250ml, bottle 750ml),
#' and alcopops (small can 250ml, small bottle 275ml, large bottle 700ml).
