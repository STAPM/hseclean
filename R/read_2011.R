#'
#' Reads and does basic cleaning on the Health Survey for England 2011.
#'
#' The HSE 2011 included a general population sample of adults and children, representative of
#' the whole population at both national and regional level. For the sample, 8,992 addresses
#' were randomly selected in 562 postcode sectors, issued over twelve months from January to
#' December 2011. Where an address was found to have multiple dwelling units, one dwelling
#' unit was selected at random and where there were multiple households at a dwelling unit, one
#' household was selected at random.
#'
#' In each selected household, all individuals were eligible for inclusion in the survey. Where
#' there were three or more children aged 0-15 in a household, two of the children were selected
#' at random. A nurse visit was arranged for all participants who consented.
#'
#' A total of 8,610 adults aged 16 and over and 2,007 children aged 0-15 were interviewed. A
#' household response rate of 66% was achieved for the core sample. Among the general
#' population sample, 5,715 adults and 1,257 children had a nurse visit.
#'
#' WEIGHTING
#'
#' 5.2 Individual weight
#'
#' For analyses at the individual level, the weighting variable to use is (wt_int). These weights are generated separately for adults and children:
#' \itemize{
#' \item for adults (aged 16 or more), the interview weights are a combination of the householdweight and a component which adjusts the sample to reduce bias from individual non-response within households;
#' \item for children (aged 0 to 15), the weights are generated from the household weights and the child selection weights â€“ the selection weights correct for only including a maximum of two children in a household. The combined household and child selection weight were adjusted to ensure that the weighted age/sex distribution matched that of all children in co-operating households.
#' }
#' For analysis of children aged 0-15 in both the Core and the Boost sample, taking into account child selection only and not adjusting for non-response, the (wt_child) variable can be used. For analysis of children aged 2-15 in the only Boost sample the (wt_childb) variable can
#'
#' 5.6 Drinking diary weight
#'
#' The drinking diary was given to all participants aged 18 and over who completed the main
#' HSE interview and had had an alcoholic drink in the previous 12 months. A drinking diary
#' weight has been generated for all adults eligible for the drinking diary. This weight
#' (wt_drink) should be used on all analysis of drinking diary questions.
#'
#' MISSING VALUES
#'
#' \itemize{
#' \item -1 Not applicable: Used to signify that a particular variable did not apply to a given respondent
#' usually because of internal routing. For example, men in women only questions.
#' \item -2 Schedule not applicable: Used mainly for variables on the self-completions when the
#' respondent was not of the given age range, also used for children without legal guardians in the
#' home who could not participate in the nurse schedule.
#' \item -8 Don't know, Can't say.
#' \item -9 No answer/ Refused
