\details{
The HSE 2009 included a general population sample of adults and children, representative of
the whole population at both national and regional level, and a boost sample of children aged
2-15. A sub-sample was identified in which the main survey was supplemented with objective
measures of physical activity and fitness. For the general population sample, 4,680 addresses
were randomly selected in 360 postcode sectors, issued over twelve months from January to
December 2009. Where an address was found to have multiple dwelling units, one was
selected at random. Where there were multiple households at a dwelling unit, up to three
households were included, and if there were more than three, a random selection was made.
At each address, all households, and all persons in them, were eligible for inclusion in the
survey. Where there were three or more children aged 0-15 in a household, two of the children
were selected at random. A nurse visit was arranged for all participants who consented.

In addition to the core general population sample, a boost sample of children aged 2-15 was
selected using 12,600 addresses, some in the same postcode sectors as the core sample and
some in an additional 180 postcode sectors to supplement the sample obtained in the core
sectors. As for the core sample, where there were three or more children in a household, two
of the children were selected at random to limit the respondent burden for parents. There was
no nurse follow up for this child boost sample.

A total of 4,645 adults and 3,957 children were interviewed, with 1,147 children from the
core sample and 2,810 from the boost. A household response rate of 68% was achieved for
the core sample, and 74% for the boost sample. Among the general population sample,
3,261 adults and 807 children had a nurse visit.

WEIGHTING

5.2 Individual weight

For analyses at the individual level, the weighting variable to use is (wt_int). These weights are generated separately for adults and children:
\itemize{
\item for adults (aged 16 or more), the interview weights are a combination of the householdweight and a component which adjusts the sample to reduce bias from individual non-response within households;
\item for children (aged 0 to 15), the weights are generated from the household weights and the child selection weights â€“ the selection weights correct for only including a maximum of two children in a household. The combined household and child selection weight were adjusted to ensure that the weighted age/sex distribution matched that of all children in co-operating households.
}
For analysis of children aged 0-15 in both the Core and the Boost sample, taking into account child selection only and not adjusting for non-response, the (wt_child) variable can be used. For analysis of children aged 2-15 in the only Boost sample the (wt_childb) variable can

MISSING VALUES

\itemize{
\item -1 Not applicable: Used to signify that a particular variable did not apply to a given respondent
usually because of internal routing. For example, men in women only questions.
\item -2 Schedule not applicable: Used mainly for variables on the self-completions when the
respondent was not of the given age range, also used for children without legal guardians in the
home who could not participate in the nurse schedule.
\item -8 Don't know, Can't say.
\item -9 No answer/ Refused
