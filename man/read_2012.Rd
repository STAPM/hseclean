\details{
The HSE 2012 included a general population sample of adults and children, representative of
the whole population at both national and regional level. For the sample, 9,024 addresses
were randomly selected in 564 postcode sectors, issued over twelve months from January to
December 2013. Where an address was found to have multiple dwelling units, one dwelling
unit was selected at random and where there were multiple households at a dwelling unit, one
household was selected at random.

A total of 8,291 adults aged 16 and over and 2,043 children aged 0-15 were interviewed. A
household response rate of 64% was achieved for the core sample. Among the general
population sample, 5,470 adults and 1,203 children had a nurse visit.

WEIGHTING

5.2 Individual weight

For analyses at the individual level, the weighting variable to use is (wt_int). These weights are generated separately for adults and children:
\itemize{
\item for adults (aged 16 or more), the interview weights are a combination of the householdweight and a component which adjusts the sample to reduce bias from individual non-response within households;
\item for children (aged 0 to 15), the weights are generated from the household weights and the child selection weights â€“ the selection weights correct for only including a maximum of two children in a household. The combined household and child selection weight were adjusted to ensure that the weighted age/sex distribution matched that of all children in co-operating households.
}
For analysis of children aged 0-15 in both the Core and the Boost sample, taking into account child selection only and not adjusting for non-response, the (wt_child) variable can be used. For analysis of children aged 2-15 in the only Boost sample the (wt_childb) variable can

MISSING VALUES

\itemize{
\item -1 Not applicable: Used to signify that a particular variable did not apply to a given respondent
usually because of internal routing. For example, men in women only questions.
\item -8 Don't know, Can't say.
\item -9 No answer/ Refused
