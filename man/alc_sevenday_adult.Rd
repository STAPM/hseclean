\description{
Processes the information from the questions on drinking in the last seven days - how many times drank and characteristics of the heaviest drinking day.
}
\details{
We estimate the number of
UK standard units of alcohol drunk on the heaviest drinking day by using the data on how many of what size measures of
different beverages were drunk, and combining this with our standard assumptions about beverage volume and alcohol content.

In 2007 new questions were added asking which glass size was used when wine was consumed.
Therefore the post HSE 2007 unit calculations are not directly comparable to previous yearsâ€™ data.
