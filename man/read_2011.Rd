\details{
The HSE 2011 included a general population sample of adults and children, representative of
the whole population at both national and regional level. For the sample, 8,992 addresses
were randomly selected in 562 postcode sectors, issued over twelve months from January to
December 2011. Where an address was found to have multiple dwelling units, one dwelling
unit was selected at random and where there were multiple households at a dwelling unit, one
household was selected at random.

In each selected household, all individuals were eligible for inclusion in the survey. Where
there were three or more children aged 0-15 in a household, two of the children were selected
at random. A nurse visit was arranged for all participants who consented.

A total of 8,610 adults aged 16 and over and 2,007 children aged 0-15 were interviewed. A
household response rate of 66% was achieved for the core sample. Among the general
population sample, 5,715 adults and 1,257 children had a nurse visit.

WEIGHTING

5.2 Individual weight

For analyses at the individual level, the weighting variable to use is (wt_int). These weights are generated separately for adults and children:
\itemize{
\item for adults (aged 16 or more), the interview weights are a combination of the householdweight and a component which adjusts the sample to reduce bias from individual non-response within households;
\item for children (aged 0 to 15), the weights are generated from the household weights and the child selection weights â€“ the selection weights correct for only including a maximum of two children in a household. The combined household and child selection weight were adjusted to ensure that the weighted age/sex distribution matched that of all children in co-operating households.
}
For analysis of children aged 0-15 in both the Core and the Boost sample, taking into account child selection only and not adjusting for non-response, the (wt_child) variable can be used. For analysis of children aged 2-15 in the only Boost sample the (wt_childb) variable can

5.6 Drinking diary weight

The drinking diary was given to all participants aged 18 and over who completed the main
HSE interview and had had an alcoholic drink in the previous 12 months. A drinking diary
weight has been generated for all adults eligible for the drinking diary. This weight
(wt_drink) should be used on all analysis of drinking diary questions.

MISSING VALUES

\itemize{
\item -1 Not applicable: Used to signify that a particular variable did not apply to a given respondent
usually because of internal routing. For example, men in women only questions.
\item -2 Schedule not applicable: Used mainly for variables on the self-completions when the
respondent was not of the given age range, also used for children without legal guardians in the
home who could not participate in the nurse schedule.
\item -8 Don't know, Can't say.
\item -9 No answer/ Refused
