\description{
We estimate the number of
UK standard units of alcohol drunk on average in a week from the questions on drinking in the last 12 months.
}
\details{
The calculation has the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Convert the categorical variables to numeric variables for the frequency with which each beverage is typically consumed (normal beer, strong beer, spirits, sherry, wine, alcopops).
\item Convert the reported volumes usually consumed (e.g. small glass, large glass) into volumes in ml, using the beverage size assumptions above. In doing so, variations in recording among years and between the interview and self-complete questionnaire are accounted for.
\item Combine the volumes (ml) usually consumed with the frequency of consumption to give the average volume of each beverage type drunk each week (assuming constant consumption across the year).
\item Convert the expected volumes of each beverage consumed each week to UK standard units of alcohol consumed, using the alcohol content assumptions above.
\item Collapse normal and strong beer into a single "beer" variable by summing their units. Collapse wine and sherry into a single "wine" variable by summing their units.
\item Calculate total weekly units but summing across beverage categories.
\item Calculate the beverage "preference vector" - the percentage of total consumption contributed by the consumption of each of four beverage types (beer, wine, spirits, alcopops).
\item Cap the total units consumed in a week at 300 units, assuming that above this already very high level of consumption estimates of variation in consumption are less reliable.
\item Categorise average weekly consumption into "abstainer", "lower_risk" (less than 14 units/week), "increasing_risk" (greater than or equal to 14 units/week and less than 35 units/week for women, and less than 50 units/week for men), "higher_risk".
\item Categorise beverage preferences - for each of the four beverages, "does_not_drink", "drinks_some" (less than or equal to 50\% of consumption), "mostly_drinks".
}
In 2007 new questions were added asking which glass size was used when wine was consumed.
Therefore the post HSE 2007 unit calculations are not directly comparable to previous yearsâ€™ data.
