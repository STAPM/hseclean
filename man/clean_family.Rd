NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN THE HOUSEHOLD

Categorised into: 0, 1, 2, 3+. The problem with the Health Survey for England is that from 2015 onwards,
the number of children in the household is
not provided as this information could be identifiable (you can get it if you apply and pay for a secure dataset).
Therefore, for years 2015+, the number of children in the household is completely missing and needs to be imputed.


RELATIONSHIP STATUS

In previous versions of modelling (e.g. the alcohol binge model) relationship status has been described as
married/not-married. Here, we include more detail by using:
\itemize{
\item single
\item married, civil partnership or cohabiting
\item separated, divorced, widowed
}
}

\dontrun{

data_2001 <- read_2001()

data_2001 <- clean_family(data = data_2001)

}
