    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>As well as providing a sample designed to give a cross-section of the population, HSE 2002 also
focussed on the health of a number of specific groups, including: infants and children (aged 0-15),
young adults (aged 16-24) and mothers with infants aged under 1. Addresses sampled in each postal
sector were systematically allocated to one of two groups: Sample I (29 addresses) or Sample II (9
addresses). Sample I was designed to boost the proportion of children, young people and mothers of
infants, and Sample II to provide a sample of the general population. At Sample I addresses all
persons aged 0-24 were eligible for inclusion in the survey, as were all mothers of infants aged under
1 (there was no upper age limit for the mothers). At Sample II addresses all persons were eligible for
interview. At both Sample I and II addresses, where there were more than two children aged 0-15, two
children were selected at random. Information was obtained directly from persons aged 13 and over.
Information about children aged under 13 was obtained from a parent, with the child present.</p>
<p>An interview with each eligible person (Stage 1) was followed by a visit by a nurse (Stage 2), who
made a number of measurements and in some cases obtained a blood sample and a saliva sample.
Both interviewers and nurses used computer-assisted interviewing. Blood and saliva samples were
sent to a laboratory for analysis.</p>
<p>WEIGHTING</p>
<p>In HSE 2002, the sample was boosted in order to obtain greater numbers of children, young adults
(aged 16-24) and mothers of infants under 1. While children aged 0-15 and young adults aged 16-24
were sampled from all selected addresses, adults aged 25 and over were selected only at Sample II
addresses (i.e. they were selected at only 9 out of the 38 addresses included within each postcode
sector). Consequently, in HSE 2002, those aged 25 and over were under-represented in the final
dataset. Different weights were applied to different age groups as explained below:</p><ul><li><p>Children aged 0-15: To compensate for limiting the number of children interviewed in a household
to two (the sampling fraction therefore being lower in households containing three or more children) it
has become necessary to weight the child sample. This ‘child weight’ is the total number of children
aged 0-15 in the household divided by the number of selected children in the household. The
weighted sample was then adjusted to ensure that the age/sex distribution matched that of all children
in co-operating households.</p></li>
<li><p>Young adults aged 16-24: As all people in the household in this age range were selected for
interview, the sample in this age group have a weight of 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Adults aged 25 and over: The under-representation of adults aged 25+ in the sample is addressed by
weighting the final dataset whereby all adults aged 25 and over are given a weight of 38/9. The
exception is natural mothers of children under the age of 1 who were selected at all addresses and
hence, were not over represented.</p></li>
<li><p>The variable child_wt contains the appropriate weights for each of the three age groups described
above. These weights were then scaled by a constant factor so that the weighted sample size across the
sample as a whole was same as the unweighted sample size. The scaled weight variable is tablewt.</p></li>
<li><p>The tables in the published volumes of the HSE2002 have been weighted using the child_wt variable.
For analysis relating to adults aged 16 and over using the both boost and general population samples,
the variable tablewt should be used.</p></li>
</ul><p>MISSING VALUES</p>
<ul><li><p>-1 Not applicable: Used to signify that a particular variable did not apply to a given respondent
usually because of internal routing. For example, men in women only questions.</p></li>
<li><p>-2 Schedule not applicable: Used mainly for variables on the self-completions when the
respondent was not of the given age range, also used for children without legal guardians in the
home who could not participate in the nurse schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>-6 Schedule not obtained: Used to signify that a particular variable was not answered because the
respondent did not complete or agree to a particular schedule (i.e. nurse schedule or selfcompletions).</p></li>
<li><p>-7 Refused/ not obtained: Used only for variables on the nurse schedules, this code indicates that a
respondent refused a particular measurement or test or the measurement was attempted but not
obtained or not attempted.</p></li>
<li><p>-8 Don't know, Can't say.</p></li>
<li><p>-9 No answer/ Refused</p></li>
