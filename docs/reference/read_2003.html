<dl><dt id="arg-root">root<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-root"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Character string - the root directory. This is the section of the file path to where the data is stored
that might vary depending on how the network drive is being accessed. The default is "X:/",
which corresponds to the University of Sheffield's X drive in the School of Health and Related Research.
Within the function, the root is pasted onto the front of the rest of the file path specified in the 'file' argument.
Thus, if root = NULL, then the complete file path is given in the 'file' argument.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-file">file<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-file"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Character string - the file path and the name and extension of the file. The function has been
designed and tested to work with tab delimited files '.tab'. Files are read by the function [data.table::fread].</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-select-cols">select_cols<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-select-cols"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Character string - select either:
"all" - keep all variables in the survey data;
"tobalc" - keep a reduced set of variables associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption and a selected set of
survey design and socio-demographic variables that are needed for the functions within the hseclean package to work.</p></dd>

<p>All private households in the general population sample are eligible for inclusion in the survey
(up to a maximum of three households per address).
Up to two children aged 0-15 are interviewed in each household,
as well as up to 10 adults aged 16 and over. Information was obtained directly
from persons aged 13 and over. Information about children under 13 was obtained from a parent with the child present.</p>

    <h2 id="weighting">Weighting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#weighting"></a></h2>



<p>In 2003, non-response weighting was introduced to the HSE data. Although the HSE has generally presented a good match to the population, this decision was taken to keep up with the recent changes on many large-scale government sponsored surveys, and with the aim of reducing the possible biases.</p>
<p>Non-response weights have been calculated for both adults and children. Four sets of non-response weights have been generated in total. Firstly a household weight was calculated to adjust for non-contact and for refusals of entire households. In addition, three sets of weights have been calculated to adjust (a) non-response among individuals in responding households (b) non-response to the nurse visit stage and (c) refusal to give a blood sample. The aim of each set of weights is that each of the main datasets (households, individuals, individuals who see a nurse, and individuals who give blood) can be treated as broadly representative of the general household population.</p>
<p>The household weight (hhld_wt) is the product of household selection weight (to adjust for addresses with more than three households per address) and the calibration weight. These weights were applied separately within Government Office Region to bring the age and sex distribution of adults and children within responding households into line with each region’s population age-sex distribution, but with the constraint that adults and children from the same household are all given the same weight. The rationale behind calibration weighting is that it attaches an estimated probability of response to each household that ‘explains’ any discrepancy between the survey age-sex distribution and the population age-sex distribution.1</p>
<p>The population control totals used for this exercise were the ONS projected population estimates for 2003, but with a small adjustment to exclude (our best estimate of) the population aged 65 and over living in communal establishments.</p>
<p>At the individual level there are three sets of weights, the interview weight (int_wt), the nurse weight (nurse_wt) and the blood weight (blood_wt). The appropriate weight variable should be used for analysis done using data from the relevant sections.</p>
<p>Children aged 0-15: To compensate for limiting the number of children interviewed in a household to two (the sampling fraction therefore being lower in households containing three or more children) it has become necessary to weight the child sample. This ‘child weight’ is the total number of children aged 0-15 in the household divided by the number of selected children in the household. The weighted sample was then adjusted to ensure that the age/sex distribution matched that of all children in co-operating households.</p>
<p>The variable child_wt contains the appropriate selection weights for children aged 0-15.</p>
<p>The variables int_wt and nurse_wt for children aged 0-15 includes both the child selection weights and non- response weights.</p>

<ul><li><p>-1 Not applicable: Used to signify that a particular variable did not apply to a given respondent
usually because of internal routing. For example, men in women only questions.</p></li>
<li><p>-2 Schedule not applicable: Used mainly for variables on the self-completions when the
respondent was not of the given age range, also used for children without legal guardians in the
home who could not participate in the nurse schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>-6 Schedule not obtained: Used to signify that a particular variable was not answered because the
respondent did not complete or agree to a particular schedule (i.e. nurse schedule or selfcompletions).</p></li>
<li><p>-7 Refused/ not obtained: Used only for variables on the nurse schedules, this code indicates that a

<p>The data is read by the function [data.table::fread]. The 'root' and 'file' arguments are
pasted together to form the file path. The following are converted to NA:
c("NA", "", "-1", "-2", "-6", "-7", "-8", "-9", "-90", "-90.0", "-99", "N/A").
All variable names are converted to lower case.
The cluster and probabilistic sampling unit have the year appended to them.
Some renaming of variables is done for consistency with other years.</p>
