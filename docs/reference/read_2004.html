<p>The Health Survey for England 2004 was designed to provide data at both national and regional level
about the population living in private households in England. **The sample design of the 2004 survey
had two parts: a general population sample that followed the same pattern as in previous years and a
minority ethnic ‘boost’ sample, designed solely to yield interviews with members of seven largest
minority ethnic groups in England: Black Caribbean, Black African, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi,
Chinese and Irish.**</p>
<p>The general population sample was half the size of the usual sample, and involved selection 6,552
addresses from the Postcode Address File (PAF) in 312 wards, issued over a twelve-month period
from January to December 2004. Up to ten adults and up to two children in each household were
interviewed, and a nurse visit arranged for those participants in minority ethnic groups who
consented.</p>
<p>In the ethnic boost sample, 41,436 addresses were randomly selected from PAF, within another 483
wards, issued over the same 12 month period, January to December 2004. All sampled addresses were
fully screened and only informants from the specified minority ethnic groups were eligible for
inclusion in the survey. Among those eligible informants at an address, up to four adults and three
children were selected for interview, with a random selection of participants if there was more than
this number in an eligible household.
In order to increase further the number of Chinese informants in 2004, the sample was supplemented
with a extra sample consisting of people with ‘Chinese sounding’ surnames obtained from the
Electoral Register (for further information see HSE 2004 report, Volume 2, Methodology and
                    documentation).</p>
<p>For informants from the specified minority ethnic groups (whether identified in the general population
                                                          sample or the minority ethnic sample), an interview with each eligible person was followed by a nurse
visit both using computer assisted interviewing. The main focus of the 2004 survey for adults from
minority ethnic backgrounds was cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related risk factors. At the nurse
visit, questions were asked about prescribed medication, vitamin supplements and nicotine
replacements. The nurse took the blood pressure of those aged 5 and over, measured lung function of
those aged 7-15, and made waist and hip measurements for those aged 11 and over. Saliva samples
were collected from 4-15 year olds and blood samples from those aged 11 and over including fasting
blood from those aged 16 and over. Blood and saliva samples were sent to a laboratory for analysis.</p>
<p>Informants in the general population sample, unless they were members of the specified minority
ethnic groups, were given a shortened version of the questionnaire covering core topics only.
For all informants, information was obtained directly from persons aged 13 and over. Information
about children under 13 was obtained from a parent with the child present.</p>

    <h2 id="weighting">Weighting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#weighting"></a></h2>



<p>General Population Data (HSE04gpa.sav)</p>
<p>Prior to 2003, the weighting strategy for the core sample in the HSE was to apply selection weights
only – no attempt was made to reduce non-response bias through weighting. However, following a
review of the weighting, non-response was also included in the weighting strategy for the HSE 2003.
We have followed the same approach for weighting the HSE 2004 general population sample data.</p>
<p>Two sets of non-response weights have been generated for the general population sample: household
weights which adjust for non-contact and refusal of households, and interview weights which also
adjust for the additional non-response among individuals in participating households.</p>
<p>**The household weight (wt_hhld) is a household level weight that corrects the distribution of
household members to match population estimates for sex/age groups and GOR.** These weights were
generated using calibration weighting, with the household selection weights as starting values. (The
household selection weights correct for where the limit of three households are selected at addresses
with more than three.) Note that the population control totals used for the calibration weighting were
the ONS projected mid-year population estimates for 2004, but with a small adjustment to exclude
(our best estimate of) the population aged 65 and over living in communal establishments.</p>
<p>For analyses at the individual level, the weighting variable to use is wt_int. These weights are
generated separately for adults and children:</p><ul><li><p>for adults (aged 16 or more), **the interview weights are a combination of the household weight
and a component which adjusts the sample to reduce bias from individual non-response within
households**;</p></li>
<li><p>for children (aged 0 to 15), **the weights are generated from the household weights and the child
selection weights – the selection weights correct for only including a maximum of two children in
a household.** The combined household and child selection weight were adjusted to ensure that the
weighted age/sex distribution matched that of all children in co-operating households.</p></li>
</ul><p>For analysis of children aged 0-15 in the General Population Sample, taking into account child
selection only and not adjusting for non-response, the child_wt variable can be used.</p>
<p>**Minority Ethnic Group Data (HSE04etha.sav)**</p>
<p>For the HSE 2004, as well as the general population sample, boost samples were selected in areas
with (relatively) higher proportions of people in minority ethnic groups. All respondents, whether
from the general population sample or the boost sample, are included in the minority ethnic group
sample. As well as the main interview, respondents in the minority ethnic group sample were also
eligible for nurse visits and to have blood taken. Therefore, three sets of weights were generated:
interview weights, plus nurse and blood weights.</p>
<p>The first stage of the weighting process was to generate weights for the probability of selecting an
address in the minority ethnic sample. Addresses in areas with different ethnic profiles had different
chances of being selected for the HSE - selection weight were generated which corrected for this.
These weights were combined with the selection weights for household within addresses and for
individuals within household to give the interview weights (wt_int).</p>
<p>All respondents in the minority ethnic group sample were eligible for a nurse visit and were also
asked to give a sample of blood (if aged 11 or more). As there was drop-out at both these stages,
separate weights were generated for the nurse visit sample (wt_nurse) and blood sample (wt_ blood).</p>
