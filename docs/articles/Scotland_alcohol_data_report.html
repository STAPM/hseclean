<p>To plot the data processed using functions in the <a href="https://stapm.github.io/hseclean/">hseclean</a> package as part of
the process of quality assurance of the preparation of input data used
in the alcohol component of the STAPM modelling for Scotland. This
document comprises exploratory plots to illustrate the SHeS data on
alcohol consumption and plots that we use to check the processing of the
data using hseclean.</p>

</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-health-survey" class="external-link">Scottish
Health Survey (SHeS)</a> is an annual series of surveys of the health
and health-related behaviours of private households in Scotland that has
been carried out annually since 2008 (and before that in 1995, 1998 and
2003). It is the source of data on alcohol consumption used to inform
the alcohol component of the Sheffield Tobacco and Alcohol Policy
Modelling. The survey asks respondents about the volume of certain types
of drinks bought or consumed over a certain time period. These volumes
are then standardised by converting them into alcohol units (one UK
standard unit = 10ml of pure ethanol). The conversion of reported
volumes to units is based on assumptions about the average alcohol
content (ABV) of different types of drink.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that this self-reported data underestimates
actual consumption by as much as 50% <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stockwell2004under" role="doc-biblioref">Stockwell et al.
2004</a>)</span>. This data check does not investigate the magnitude of
such underestimation or the potential biases introduced.</p>
<p>The Scottish Health Survey estimates alcohol consumption for people
age 16 and over. Participants who reported that they drank were asked
how often during the past 12 months they had drink each of six different
types of alcoholic drink:</p>
<ul>
<li>normal beer, lager, stout, cider and shandy</li>
<li>strong beer, lager, stout and cider</li>
<li>sherry and Martini</li>
<li>spirits and liqueurs</li>
<li>wine</li>
<li>alcoholic soft drinks (alcopops)</li>
</ul>
<p>From these questions, the average number of days per week the
participant had drunk was estimated. A further question then asks how
much of each drink type they had usually drunk on each occasion.</p>
<p>The main report for the Scottish Health Survey 2018 volume 1 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mclean2018scottish" role="doc-biblioref">McLean et al. 2018</a>)</span> gives the conversion
factors used to convert the quantity-frequency survey questions into
estimated units of average weekly alcohol consumption.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>The SHeS data is processed for use in the STAPM modelling by
standardised and version controlled R code functions in the <a href="https://stapm.github.io/hseclean/">hseclean</a> R package. Project
specific code draws on these functions to process the SHeS data into
STAPM inputs.</p>
<p>Someone is classed as a current drinker if they reported drinking at
all in the last 12 months e.g. even if reporting only having 1-2 drinks
a year. There is no alcohol data collected for children, therefore we
retain under 16s in our data, but assign them ‘NA’ for all alcohol
questions. Any missing data is supplemented by responses to if currently
drinks or if always non-drinker.</p>
<p>The hseclean method applies different assumptions to those used by
the providers of the SHeS data to convert the quantity-frequency survey
questions into estimated units of average weekly alcohol consumption.
The method in hseclean is based on the method used in the 2014 report by
the Sheffield Alcohol Research Group on the potential impacts of alcohol
minimum unit pricing in Scotland <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-angus2016model" role="doc-biblioref">Angus et al.
2016</a>)</span>. One of the jobs of this data check is to compare
between the hseclean and SHeS methods.</p>
<p>In the current version of hseclean, the percentage alcohol by volume
(ABV) estimates used are:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.4% for normal beer, lager, stout, cider and shandy</li>
<li>8.4% for strong beer, lager, stout and cider</li>
<li>17% for sherry and martini</li>
<li>38% for spirits and liqueurs</li>
<li>12.5% for wine</li>
<li>4.5% for alcoholic soft drinks (alcopops)</li>
</ul>
<p>These assumptions are used in conjunction with the following
assumptions about the volumes (ml) of different types of alcoholic
drink:</p>
<ul>
<li>normal beer, lager, stout, cider and shandy: half pint 284ml, small
can 330ml, large can 440ml, bottle 330ml</li>
<li>strong beer, lager, stout and cider: half pint 284ml, small can
330ml, large can 440ml, bottle 330ml</li>
<li>sherry and martini: serving 50ml</li>
<li>spirits and liqueurs: serving 25ml</li>
<li>wine: small glass 125ml, standard glass 175ml, large glass 250ml,
bottle 750ml</li>
<li>alcoholic soft drinks (alcopops): small can 250ml, small bottle
275ml, large bottle 700ml</li>
</ul>

<p>The plots below investigate the differences between two different

<p>The SHeS and hseclean methods use different assumptions about the
volume of alcoholic beverages and the percentage alcohol by volume - see
details above. Despite the different assumptions used, the validation
check should confirm that the two methods produce approximately the same
estimates of the average weekly amount of alcohol consumed.</p>
