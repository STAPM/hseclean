</h2>
<p>This vignette sets out a description of how the data related to
tobacco and alcohol consumption in the Health Survey for England are
processed for use in the Sheffield Tobacco and Alcohol Policy Modelling
(STAPM). The vignette covers: (1) the processing of alcohol consumption
data; the processing of tobacco consumption data; the processing of
socio-demographic covariates relevant to our tobacco and alcohol
modelling; the imputation of missing data. This is a working set of
notes to help keep track of the methods used to process the data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="background">Background<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#background"></a>
</h2>
<p>The Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model (SAPM) has been used to examine
the effects of pricing policies, advertising restrictions and advice on
why and how to reduce drinking <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Holmes2014">Holmes et al. 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-purshouse2013modelling">Purshouse et al. 2013</a>)</span>
(see the range of publications and projects on the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr/research/themes/alpol" class="external-link">Sheffield
Alcohol Research Group website</a>). Patterns of alcohol consumption in
the SAPM modelling are informed primarily by the Health Survey for
England data, with additional information e.g. on the division of
alcohol consumption between the on- and off-trade provided by the Living
Costs and Food Survey.</p>

<h2 id="approach-to-coding">Approach to coding<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#approach-to-coding"></a>
</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.com/stapm/r-packages/hseclean" class="external-link">hseclean</a> R
package was written to help standardise the processing of the Health
Survey for England data to produce inputs for the STAPM simulation
modelling. This helps data storage and processing to be consistent
across the STAPM projects. The code reads, cleans, filters and combines
data from multiple survey years.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="alcohol-consumption">Alcohol consumption<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#alcohol-consumption"></a>
</h2>
<p>Alcohol consumption data in the Health Survey for England (HSE) is
recorded in four main forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>How often someone usually drinks<br>
</li>
<li>For adults considering the last 12 months, what they drink on
average<br>
</li>
<li>For adults considering the last week, when they drank the most<br>
</li>
<li>For children considering the last week, what they drank</li>
</ul>
<p>Both adults and children have data on whether they drink alcohol or
not, and on the frequency of drinking. The main difference between the
recording of data for adults and children is that adults have a lot of
data on how much and what they drink, but children only have data on the
amount drunk in the last week.</p>
<p>The recording of data varies among years of the HSE. We consider
years from 2001 onwards. The main features of these changes in recording
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adult drinking in the last 12 months is only recorded for years
2001, 2002, and 2011 onwards.<br>
</li>
<li>Adult drinking in the last 12 months is recorded in different terms
for 2001/2 and 2011+.<br>
</li>
<li>In 2007, the way that wine was recorded changed from asking how many
glasses (with a size of 125ml assumed) to asking how many glasses of
either 125ml, 175ml or 250ml. Therefore the post HSE 2007 unit
calculations are not directly comparable to previous years’ data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the variability in recording, we only consider data on the
amount drunk by adults and children from 2011 onwards.</p>
<p>We analyse beverage-specific alcohol consumption in terms of beer
(combining normal beer, strong beer), wine (combining wine and sherry),
spirits, and alcopops.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="whether-someone-drinks-and-frequency-of-drinking">Whether someone drinks and frequency of drinking<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#whether-someone-drinks-and-frequency-of-drinking"></a>
</h3>
<p>Calculated for adults (aged 16 years or older) and children (aged 8
to 15 years) by the function
<code><a href="../reference/alc_drink_now_allages.html">hseclean::alc_drink_now_allages()</a></code>. We combine the
information on drinking frequency from adults and children into a single
variable.</p>
<p>We calculate the variable <code>drinks_now</code>, which classes
someone as either a drinker or a non-drinker. Adults are classed as
drinkers if they reported drinking at all in the last 12 months, even if
reporting only having 1-2 drinks a year (according to the variable
<code>dnoft</code>). Note that this definition of a non-drinker can vary
among surveys, e.g. some surveys class only having 1-2 drinks a year as
a non-drinker, and this could lead to variation in estimates of the
number of non-drinkers.</p>
<p>We calculate the variable <code>drink_freq_7d</code>, which is a
numerical variable that described drinking frequency. Adult drinking
frequency is also inferred from the variable <code>dnoft</code>: the
function <code><a href="../reference/alc_drink_freq.html">hseclean::alc_drink_freq()</a></code> converts the
categorical responses into the expected number of days in a week that
someone drinks.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Almost every day” = 7 days a week<br>
</li>
<li>“Five or six days a week” = 5.5 days a week<br>
</li>
<li>“Three or four days a week” = 3.5 days a week<br>
</li>
<li>“Once or twice a week” = 1.5 days a week<br>
</li>
<li>“Once or twice a month” = 0.375 days a week<br>
</li>
<li>“Once every couple of months” = 0.188 days a week<br>
</li>
<li>“Once or twice a year” = 0.029 days a week</li>
</ul>
<p>Missing data on whether or not someone currently drinks
(<code>drinks_now</code>) is supplemented by responses to if currently
drinks or if always non-drinker (the variables <code>dnnow</code>,
<code>dnany</code> and <code>dnevr</code>).</p>
<p>For children (aged 8-15 years) we infer whether someone drinks or not
(<code>drinks_now</code>) from the variable <code>adrinkof</code>.
Someone is a non-drinker if they responded <code>never</code> to
<code>adrinkof</code>. The categorical responses are converted into the
expected number of days in a week that someone drinks as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>“Almost every day” = 7 days a week<br>
</li>
<li>“Twice a week” = 2 days a week<br>
</li>
<li>“Once a week” = 1 days a week<br>
</li>
<li>“Once a fortnight” = 0.5 days a week<br>
</li>
<li>“Once a month” = 0.25 days a week<br>
</li>
<li>“Only a few times a year” = 0.058 days a week</li>
</ul>
<p>Missing data on whether or not a child currently drinks
(<code>drinks_now</code>) is supplemented by responses to when they last
had an alcoholic drink (<code>adrlast</code>): if the last drink was
less than six months ago, then we classify them as a drinker; if the
last drink was six months or more ago, then we classify them as a
non-drinker.</p>

</h4>
<p>Some standard assumptions are made about the volume and alcohol
content of the beverages that are reported to be drunk. The values that
we use for these assumptions are based on those used by Natcen to create
the derived variables for units of alcohol consumed in the HSE. We have
made our own adjustments to the values used based on further information
from market research data and figures from academic publications.</p>
<p>Alcohol content assumptions are the expected percentages of alcohol
that each beverage contains (alcohol by volume, ABV). We use separate
values for normal beer (4.4%), strong beer (8.4%), spirits (38%), sherry
(17%), wine (12.5%), and alcopops (also known as “ready to drink” or
RTD) (4.5%).</p>
<p>Beverage volume assumptions are the expected volumes (ml) of
different beverage containers / serving sizes. We use separate values
for normal and strong beer (half pint 284ml, small can 330ml, large can
440ml, bottle 330ml), spirits (serving 25ml), sherry (serving 50ml),
wine (small glass 125ml, standard glass 175ml, large glass 250ml, bottle
750ml), and alcopops (small can 250ml, small bottle 275ml, large bottle
700ml).</p>

</h4>
<p>We estimate the average amount drunk in a week
(<code>weekmean</code>) in terms of UK standard units of alcohol (1 unit
= 10ml or 8g pure ethanol). The average amount drunk is then categorised
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>abstainer</code> = 0 units/week<br>
</li>
<li>
<code>lower_risk</code> drinker = less than 14 units/week<br>
</li>
<li>
<code>increasing_risk</code> drinker = 14 or more units/week but
less than 35 units/week for females or less than 50 units/week for
males<br>
</li>
<li>
<code>higher_risk</code> drinker = 35 or more units/week for females
or 50 or more units/week for males</li>
</ul>
<p>Separate variables are produced describing the average weekly units
in four beverage categories: <code>beer_units</code> (including cider),
<code>wine_units</code> (including sherry), <code>spirit_units</code>,
<code>rtd_units</code> (this is alcopops). Further variables on beverage
preference are produced that:</p>
<ul>
<li>describe the percentage of the total consumption in a week that is
contributed by each beverage type (<code>per_spirit_units</code>,
<code>perc_wine_units</code>, <code>perc_beer_units</code>,
<code>perc_rtd_units</code>).<br>
</li>
<li>describe whether or not someone shows a clear beverage preference
e.g. <code>does_not_drink_spirits</code>,
<code>drinks_some_spirits</code>, <code>mostly_drinks_spirits</code>,
where “mostly drinks” is defined by a single beverage comprising more
that 50% of an individuals average weekly consumption.</li>
</ul>
<p>The processing is done by the function
<code><a href="../reference/alc_weekmean_adult.html">hseclean::alc_weekmean_adult()</a></code>. The calculation has the
following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert the categorical variables to numeric variables for the
frequency with which each beverage is typically consumed (normal beer,
strong beer, spirits, sherry, wine, alcopops).<br>
</li>
<li>Convert the reported volumes usually consumed (e.g. small glass,
large glass) into volumes in ml, using the beverage size assumptions
above. In doing so, variations in recording among years and between the
interview and self-complete questionnaire are accounted for.<br>
</li>
<li>Combine the volumes (ml) usually consumed with the frequency of
consumption to give the average volume of each beverage type drunk each
week (assuming constant consumption across the year).<br>
</li>
<li>Convert the expected volumes of each beverage consumed each week to
UK standard units of alcohol consumed, using the alcohol content
assumptions above.<br>
</li>
<li>Collapse normal and strong beer into a single “beer” variable by
summing their units. Collapse wine and sherry into a single “wine”
variable by summing their units.<br>
</li>
<li>Calculate total weekly units but summing across beverage
categories.<br>
</li>
<li>Cap the total units consumed in a week at 300 units, assuming that
above this already very high level of consumption estimates of variation
in consumption are less reliable.</li>

</h4>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/alc_sevenday_adult.html">hseclean::alc_sevenday_adult()</a></code> processes
the information from the questions on adult (16 or more years old)
drinking in the last seven days:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of days drank on in the last seven,
<code>n_days_drink</code>.<br>
</li>
<li>the characteristics of drinking on the heaviest drinking day</li>
</ul>
<p>We estimate the number of UK standard units of alcohol drunk on the
heaviest drinking day (<code>peakday</code>) by using the data on how
many of what size measures of different beverages were drunk, and
combining this with our standard assumptions about beverage volume and
alcohol content. We further estimate their total units drunk of each
beverage type on the heaviest drinking day (<code>d7nbeer_units</code>,
<code>d7sbeer_units</code>, <code>d7spirits_units</code>,
<code>d7sherry_units</code>, <code>d7wine_units</code>,
<code>d7pops_units</code>).</p>
<p>Binge drinking status is then categorised into the variable
<code>binge_cat</code>, with levels <code>did_not_drink</code>,
<code>binge</code> and <code>no_binge</code>, where a binge day in
defined by males drinking over 8 units and females drinking over 6
units.</p>
<p>Note that in 2007 new questions were added asking which glass size
was used when wine was consumed. Therefore the post HSE 2007 unit
calculations are not directly comparable to previous years’ data.</p>
<p>Missing data is imputed using the means of people who did drink in
the last seven days, stratified by year, sex, IMD quintile and age
category (0-1, 2-4, 5-7, 8-10, 11-12, 13-15, 16-17, 18-19, 20-24, 25-29,
30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79,

</h4>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/alc_sevenday_child.html">hseclean::alc_sevenday_child()</a></code> processes
the information on drinking by children (ages 13-15) in the last seven
days. The data on children’s drinking comes in the form of survey
questions on whether or not they have drunk each beverage type in the
last week, and if so, how much of each was drunk. The main output is the
variable <code>total_units7_ch</code> - the total units drunk in the
last seven days.</p>
<p>We estimate the number of UK standard units of alcohol drunk in the
last 7 days by using the data on how many of what size measures of
different beverages were drunk, and combining this with our standard
assumptions about beverage volume and alcohol content.</p>
<p>The information from this question is also used to update the
<code>drinks_now</code> variable to make it a variable that describes
whether or not adults and children drink.</p>
<p>Due to high missingness in this variable, we assume that anyone who
has missing data for this variable does not drink. This means that we
are likely to under-estimate the number of children who drink.</p>

<h2 id="tobacco-consumption">Tobacco consumption<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tobacco-consumption"></a>
</h2>
<p>For the Sheffield Tobacco Policy Model (STPM), we use HSE data from
years 2001 to the latest available (although survey weights started to
be used from 2003, which is likely to make the data from 2003 slightly
more reliable). We use these data to inform the trends in smoking
prevalence, the socio-demographic variation in smoking prevalence, and
as inputs to a procedure that we use to infer the age-specific
probabilities of smoking initiation and quitting (see our <a href="https://gitlab.com/stapm/r-packages/smktrans" class="external-link">smktrans</a> R
package). Our upper age limit is 89 years, but otherwise we make use of
all ages.</p>
<p>The purpose of this vignette is to explain how we use the HSE data to
inform the patterns of tobacco smoking, and to explain how
<code>hseclean</code> supports this.</p>
<p>Questions about cigarette smoking have been asked of adults aged 16
and over as part of the HSE series since 1991 - we use data from 2001 to
the latest year available. We use data on children (12-15 years) and
adults (16+ years). There is often a special section in the annual HSE
report devoted to describing trends in cigarette smoking e.g.<a href="https://files.digital.nhs.uk/publicationimport/pub22xxx/pub22610/hse2015-adult-smo.pdf" class="external-link">HSE
2015</a>.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="cigarette-smoking-status">Cigarette smoking status<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cigarette-smoking-status"></a>
</h3>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/smk_status.html">hseclean::smk_status()</a></code> categorises
cigarette smoking into current, former and never regular cigarette
smokers. If some smokes either regularly or occasionally, then they are
classified as a current regular cigarette smoker. People who used to
smoke regularly or occasionally are classified as former smokers; people
who have only tried a cigarette once or twice are classified as never
smokers. We create a smoking status variable for children aged 8-15
years and adults aged &gt;= 16 years. Ever-smokers are people who are
either current or former smokers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="quitting">Quitting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#quitting"></a>
</h3>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/smk_quit.html">hseclean::smk_quit()</a></code> is in development, and
will process the data on the motivation to quit smoking, the reasons for
quitting smoking, and the support used to stop smoking. It currently
produces only one variable - whether someone wants to quit smoking
(y/n).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="former-smoking">Former smoking<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#former-smoking"></a>
</h3>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/smk_former.html">hseclean::smk_former()</a></code> cleans the data for
former smokers on the time since quitting and time spent as a regular
smoker. The main issue to overcome is that in the HSE 2015+, time since
quit and time spent as a smoker is provided in categories rather than
single years. We simulate the single years by just picking a value at
random within the time interval, using <code><a href="../reference/num_sim.html">hseclean::num_sim()</a></code>.
We then fill missing data for these variables as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>For children 8-15 years, we assume that missing values for former
smokers’ time since quitting and time spent as a former smoker = 1
year.<br>
</li>
<li>For adults, we fill missing values for former smokers’ time since
quitting and time spent as a former smoker with the average value for
each age, sex and IMD quintile subgroup.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="smoking-life-histories">Smoking life-histories<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#smoking-life-histories"></a>
</h3>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/smk_life_history.html">hseclean::smk_life_history()</a></code> cleans the
data on the ages when smokers started and stopped being regular
cigarette smokers. For each individual smoker, the data recorded in the
HSE implies a single age at which a smoker started to smoke and, if they
stopped, an age at which they did so. This provides a simplified view of
what might be a complicated life history of smoking, e.g. smoking to
different frequencies or levels, or starting and stopping multiple
times.</p>
<p>Both the start age and stop age will have error in them e.g. due to
uncertainty in respondent recall, and, for years 2015+, due to the
reporting in categories of time intervals rather than single years,
which we then impute introducing random error. Start age is likely to be
biased towards earlier ages, because for adult smokers and former
smokers with missing values we use the age first tried a cigarette, and
for children the reported start age does not necessarily mean the start
of regular smoking, it is just the age at which they started to
smoke.</p>
<p>We also create a variable for the age at which an individual was
censored from our data sample - this is their age at the survey + 1
year.</p>
<p>Any missing data is assigned the average start or stop age for each
age, sex and IMD quintile.</p>

</h3>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/smk_amount.html">hseclean::smk_amount()</a></code> cleans the data that
describe how much, what and to what level of addiction people smoke. The
main variable is the average number of cigarettes smoked per day. For
adults, this is calculated from questions about how many cigarettes are
smoked typically on a weekday vs. a weekend (this is a weighted average
to account for more weekdays in a week than weekends). For children,
this is based on asking how many cigarettes were smoked in the last
week. Missing values are imputed as the average amount smoked for an
age, sex and IMD quintile subgroup.</p>
<p>We categorise cigarette preferences based on the answer to ‘what is
the main type of cigarette smoked’. For years 2013 and later of the HSE,
questions were added that ask how many handrolled vs. machine rolled
cigarettes are smoked on a weekday vs. a weekend.</p>
<p>We also categorise the amount smoked, and use information on the time
from waking until smoking the first cigarette (this latter variable has
a high level of missingness). Together these two variables allow
calculation of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3307335/" class="external-link">the
heaviness of smoking index</a>.</p>

<p>Taking the survey design into account is important when estimating
the mean and confidence intervals around summary statistics computed
from the data i.e. it is not possible to accurately estimate sampling
error without accounting for survey design. The <code>survey</code> R
package <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Rsurvey">Thomas Lumley
2019</a>)</span> has a collection of functions that incorporate survey
design into the calculation of summary statistics. The
<code>survey</code> package is used by the function
<code><a href="../reference/prop_summary.html">prop_summary()</a></code> in <code>hseclean</code> to estimate the
uncertainty around proportions calculated from a binary variable -
<code><a href="../reference/prop_summary.html">prop_summary()</a></code> was designed to simplify the process of
estimating smoking prevalence from the HSE data, stratified by a
specified set of variables.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="covariate-data">Covariate data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#covariate-data"></a>
</h2>
<p>The suppliers of the HSE data introduced tighter information
governance rules in 2015, which meant that they stopped providing
variables that could be used to identify the age in single years of an
individual, and also stopped providing information on number of children
in the household. These variables can still be obtained, but only after
applying for the secure-access version of the data, which we do not do.
Therefore, in our processing of the standard-access version of the data,
we use imputation methods to overcome the added restrictions.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="survey-design-variables">Survey design variables<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#survey-design-variables"></a>
</h3>
<p>The first thing to consider is the influence of survey sampling
design, which is variable among years. The variables that describe the
sampling structure are <code>cluster</code> and <code>PSU</code>
(probabilistic sampling unit).</p>
<p>In most years there are also survey weights, which are calculated
after the survey data has been collected, that when applied are supposed
to make the survey sample representative of the general population
e.g. if a particular subgroup has been under-sampled, then it receives a
higher survey weight. As we understand the HSE methods, the survey
weights supplied with the data consider only the age and sex
distribution of the population, and do not consider the distribution of
socio-economic or health characteristics. The definition and structure
of the survey weights provided with the data varies between years, and
is described in the dataset documentation for each year of data. For
example, some key changes</p>
<ul>
<li>For 2001, there were not survey weights for adults but there were
for children (to correct for the sampling design that not all children
in the household being surveyed).<br>
</li>
<li>For 2002, there were different weights for children, young adults
(&lt; 25 years) and older adults. These weights again were just to
correct for the sampling design.<br>
</li>
<li>In 2003, non-response weighting was introduced to the HSE data for
children and adults.<br>
</li>
<li>Thereafter, weights made the additional corrections for the various
boost samples in each year.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>hseclean</code> contains separate functions for reading the
survey data for each year, e.g. <code><a href="../reference/read_2001.html">read_2001()</a></code>, and a
description of the survey weights has been added to the help files of
those functions. Any processing or combining of survey weights is done
in the functions that read each year of data. The function
<code><a href="../reference/clean_surveyweights.html">clean_surveyweights()</a></code> assigns any missing weights the
average weight for each year, and standardises the weights to sum to 1
within each year. The resulting survey weight variable for each year is
<code>wt_int</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="age">Age<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#age"></a>
</h3>
<p>From 2015 onwards, the HSE no longer supplies age in single years (to
prevent individual identification). For our modelling, we require age in
single years, so we apply a method that randomly assigns an age in
single years to individuals for who we only have an age category. The
age categories we work with are: 0-1, 2-4, 5-7, 8-10, 11-12, 13-15,
16-17, 18-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59,
60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85-89, 90+. These categories are the
finest scale version of age that is available for years 2015+. We then
select only individuals younger than 90 years for our modelling.</p>
<p>This processing is done by the function <code><a href="../reference/clean_age.html">clean_age()</a></code> that
calls the function <code><a href="../reference/num_sim.html">num_sim()</a></code> to simulate single years of
age. For years 2015+, we also use <code><a href="../reference/num_sim.html">num_sim()</a></code> to convert the
categorical variables for years since quitting smoking and years spent
as a smoker to single years of age.</p>

<p>Previous SAPM modelling has used a simple white/non-white

in social surveys (<a href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ethnic-Group-June-17.pdf" class="external-link">ONS,
2017</a>). The use of ethnicity measures is also discussed in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2059799116642885" class="external-link">Connelly
et al. 2016</a>, who recommend testing the sensitivity of analyses to
different specifications. We try to map the HSE categories to the ONS
recommended groups for England. However, over the years, the HSE is not
clear or consistent in how they have categorised chinese and arab as
‘asian’ or ‘other’. In an attempt to harmonise, we have pooled the asian
and other categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>White (English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, other European)</li>
<li>Mixed / multiple ethnic groups</li>
<li>Asian / Asian British (includes African-Indian, Indian, Pakistani,
Bangladeshi), plus Other ethnic group (includes Chinese, Japanese,
Philippino, Vietnamese, Arab)</li>
<li>Black / African / Caribbean / Black British (includes Caribbean,
African)</li>
</ul>
<p>Following inspection of the data, the white/non-white classification
does look appropriate, especially given the likely limited sample sizes
- so the 2 level variable has also been created. Previous Sheffield
modelling in the Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model has also used the
white/non-white classification.</p>

<h3 id="townsend-quintiles-of-deprivation">Townsend quintiles of deprivation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#townsend-quintiles-of-deprivation"></a>
</h3>
<p>Individuals in the HSE are not assigned a Townsend quintile of
deprivation, but for a project that investigated the cost of alcohol to
primary care in England, we needed to predict the Townsend quintile of
each individual so that we could use it to stratify our summary of
alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/use_townsend.html">use_townsend()</a></code> adds a Townsend variable to
the data. It produces a version of the Health Survey for England data
that has the Townsend Index in it, based on the probabilistic mapping
between the 2015 English Index of Multiple Deprivation and the Townsend
Index from the 2001 census.</p>
<p>It does so based on a matrix (stored in
<code><a href="../reference/imdq_to_townsend.html">hseclean::imdq_to_townsend</a></code>) that maps quintiles of the
Index of Multiple Deprivation onto the Townsend Index of Deprviation. To
produce this we used <a href="https://census.ukdataservice.ac.uk/get-data/related/deprivation" class="external-link">area-level
Office for National Statistics data</a> to estimate the statistical
association between the two metrics of deprivation. We used estimates of
the Townsend Index from 2001 Census data at Ward level, and the Index of
Multiple Deprivation 2015 (IMD 2015) at Lower-layer Super Output Area
(LSOA) level. First, we mapped the <a href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/fe6e0ebc-8def-4cc6-a228-1968ccca3dd2/lower-layer-super-output-area-2001-to-ward-2001-lookup-in-england-and-wales" class="external-link">2001

<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/clean_economic_status.html">clean_economic_status()</a></code> creates a variety
of variables to classify economic status.</p>
<p>The issues around using occupation-based social classifications for
social survey research are discussed by Connelly et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Connelly2016a">2016</a>)</span>. They
advise using a range of alternative measures, and not creating new
measures beyond what is already established.</p>
<p>The classifications considered are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employed / in paid work or not.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/otherclassifications/thenationalstatisticssocioeconomicclassificationnssecrebasedonsoc2010" class="external-link">NS-SEC
measure</a> which was constructed to measure the employment relations
and conditions of occupations (i.e. it classifies people based on their
employment occupation). It is therefore not that good at classifying
people who are not employed for various reasons.<br>
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://humanrights.brightblue.org.uk/blog-1/2016/5/6/measuring-social-class" class="external-link">NRS
social grade system</a>. This measure is the one used in the Tobacco and
Alcohol Toolkit studies, but is not reported in the Health Survey for
England. We create this variable by recategorising the NS-SEC 8 level
variable. This is important to facilitate the link of analysis to the
Toolkit Study.<br>
</li>
<li>Manual vs. non-manual occupation. In the 2017 Tobacco control plan
for England, there was a specific target to reduce the difference in
rates of smoking between people classified with a manual or non-manual
occupation. We create this variable from the 3 level NS-SEC
classification by grouping Managerial and professional with intermediate
occupations to give the non-manual group.<br>
</li>
<li>Economic status - retired / employed / unemployed.<br>
</li>
<li>Activity status for last week that adds more detail such as ‘in
education’ and ‘looking after home or family’.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="education">Education<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#education"></a>
</h3>
<p>The main education variable produced by the function
<code><a href="../reference/clean_education.html">clean_education()</a></code> is a four category description of the age
at which someone finished full-time education. The categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>never went to school,<br>
</li>
<li>left at 15 years or younger,<br>
</li>
<li>left at 16-18,<br>
</li>
<li>left at 19 years or over.</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone was still in full time education at the time of the
survey, then if they were younger than 18 years, we assumed they would
leave at 16-18, and if they were older than 18 years, we assumed they
would leave at 19 years or over.</p>
<p>A further education variable is also produced - which indicates
whether an individual reached a degree as their top qualification or
not. Here a degree is defined as an “NVQ4/NVQ5/Degree or equiv”.</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="number-of-children-in-the-household">Number of children in the household<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#number-of-children-in-the-household"></a>
</h4>
<p><code>kids</code> is the number of children aged 0-15 years who live
in the household. If a 3 year old lives in a household with 2 siblings,
aged 6 and 8 years, then we might expect them to be recorded as living
in a household with 3 children under age 15 years. The variable is
created by combining the HSE data on children and infants in the
household. It is categorised into: 0, 1, 2, 3+ children under age 15
years.</p>
<p>The problem with the Health Survey for England is that from 2015
onwards, the number of children in the household is not provided as this
information could be identifiable (you can get it if you apply and pay
for a secure dataset). Therefore, for years 2015+, the number of
children in the household is completely missing and needs to be
imputed.</p>
<p>We impute the number of children for years 2015+ automatically in the
function <code><a href="../reference/clean_family.html">clean_family()</a></code>, based on the correlation between
the number of children and a range of demographic and socioeconomic
variables in 2012-2014, the last three years for which data on kids is
available. This imputation is based on the fit of a multinomial model in
<code>package(nnet)</code>. The model object is saved in the
<code>hseclean</code> package as the object
<code><a href="../reference/impute_kids_model.html">hseclean::impute_kids_model</a></code>, and is drawn upon by the
<code><a href="../reference/clean_family.html">clean_family()</a></code> function to impute the data as needed. This
imputation won’t work unless the required demographic and socio-economic
variables have already been cleaned prior to running
<code><a href="../reference/clean_family.html">clean_family()</a></code>. There will still be missing values in
<code>kids</code> if there are missing values in the predictor variables
required by the model. These missing values can be taken care of in a
multiple imputation procedure (see vignette(missing_data)).</p>

</h3>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/clean_income.html">clean_income()</a></code> processes the data on
income.</p>
<p>There are a few different options for classifying income - the need
to have a measure that is consistent across years of the Health Survey
for England has led us to use equivalised income quintiles only. (Past
SAPM modelling has used years of the HSE for which a continous variable
for equivalised income was provided - and calculated our own income
groups - but in later years, this continuous income variable is not
available.)</p>
<p>In the past SAPM modelling, a measure of in “poverty” vs. “not in
poverty” has been used, where the poverty threshold is defined as 60% of
the median income for any year. For years in which we only have income
quintiles available, it is not possible to make an exact calculation of
poverty, but being in poverty will coincide approximately with the
lowest 2 income quintiles.</p>
<p>It would also be possible from the Health Survey for England to
classify people as being in receipt of benefits or not, but this is not
currently implemented in <code>hseclean</code>, and would have to have
some thought on how to deal with the changing definitions of benefits
over time.</p>

<p>To prepare for the process that imputes missing data, run the full
set of functions to read and clean the data. It is important to note
that there has already been some filling-in of missing data done by
these cleaning functions - using simple rules,</p>
<ul>
<li>For 2015+, the <code><a href="../reference/clean_age.html">clean_age()</a></code> function has randomly
assigned single years of age within each age category.<br>
</li>
<li>If someone is classified as a current smoker, is younger than 16 and
has missing data on the time between waking and having their first
cigarette, we assume that this time is one hour or more.<br>
</li>
<li>If someone is younger than age 16 and has missing data on their
number of children (for survey years prior to 2015), we assume that they
had no children.<br>
</li>
<li>If someone of any age is classified as a current smoker but has a
missing value for the amount smoked, then we fill that missing value
with the average amount smoked within a year, age, sex and IMD quintile
subgroup.<br>
</li>
<li>Information on education, employment and socioeconomic status is
triangulated across several variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of children in the household is missing for years 2015+.
This is imputed in the function <code><a href="../reference/clean_family.html">clean_family()</a></code> based on the
fit of a multinomial model to years 2012-2014 (see
<code>vignette("covariate_data")</code>).</p>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/select_data.html">select_data()</a></code> has the option to filter the
data to retain only complete cases for certain variables. To prepare the
data, the example code below filters out any incomplete data on key
survey variables (age, sex, year, quarter, psu, cluster, imd_quintile).
It also filters out any incomplete information on the key smoking and
drinking variables, “cig_smoker_status” and “drinks_now”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="multiple-imputation">Multiple imputation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#multiple-imputation"></a>
</h2>
<p>The variable with the most missingness in the data is income5cat (19%
missing). In this example, the other variables to be imputed are: kids,
ethnicity_4cat, eduend4cat, degree, relationship_status, nssec3_lab,
activity_lstweek.</p>
<p>To conduct the multiple imputation, we use the R package
<code>mice</code> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Rmice">Stef van
Buuren and Karin Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011</a>)</span>. The process of
running the multiple imputation can take a long time and consume a lot
of RAM. There is a range of <code>mice</code> documentation and
tutorials online.</p>
<p>In <code>hseclean</code>, multiple imputation is implemented in a
basic way by the <code><a href="../reference/impute_data_mice.html">impute_data_mice()</a></code> function.</p>
<p><code>mice</code> fits a chained series of regression equations that
predict the missing values of variables based on their relationships
with other selected variables in the data. The
<code><a href="../reference/impute_data_mice.html">impute_data_mice()</a></code> function currently only imputes
categorical variables, which could be one of three types: “logreg” -
binary Logistic regression; “polr” - ordered Proportional odds model;
“polyreg” - unordered Polytomous logistic regression.</p>
<p>In running the multiple imputation, the number of iterations of the
imputed data is selected (choosing a small number e.g. &lt; 5 helps keep
the size of the resulting imputed data manageable), and the variables to
either be predicted or to inform the prediction are selected. If a
variable is just going to inform the prediction of the other variables
but is not going to be predicted itself, then the model type is set to
““, otherwise to one of”logreg”, “polr” or “polyreg”.</p>
