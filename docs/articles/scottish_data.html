<h3 id="economic-status">Economic status<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#economic-status"></a>
</h3>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/clean_economic_status.html">clean_economic_status()</a></code> creates a variety
of variables to classify economic status.</p>
<p>The issues around using occupation-based social classifications for
social survey research are discussed by Connelly et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Connelly2016a" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. They advise using a range of
alternative measures, but not creating new measures beyond what is
already established.</p>
<p>The classifications considered from the Health Survey for England
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employed / in paid work or not.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/otherclassifications/thenationalstatisticssocioeconomicclassificationnssecrebasedonsoc2010" class="external-link">NS-SEC
measure</a> which was constructed to measure the employment relations
and conditions of occupations (i.e. it classifies people based on their
employment occupation). It is therefore not that good at classifying
people who are not employed for various reasons.<br>
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://humanrights.brightblue.org.uk/blog-1/2016/5/6/measuring-social-class" class="external-link">NRS
social grade system</a>. This measure is the one used in the Tobacco and
Alcohol Toolkit studies, but is not reported in the Health Survey for
England. We create this variable by recategorising the NS-SEC 8 level
variable. This is important to facilitate the link of analysis to the
Toolkit Study.<br>
</li>
<li>Manual vs. non-manual occupation. In the 2017 Tobacco control plan
for England, there was a specific target to reduce the difference in
rates of smoking between people classified with a manual or non-manual
occupation. We create this variable from the 3 level NS-SEC
classification by grouping Managerial and professional with intermediate
occupations to give the non-manual group.<br>
</li>
<li>Economic status - retired / employed / unemployed.<br>
</li>
<li>Activity status for last week that adds more detail such as ‘in
education’ and ‘looking after home or family’.</li>
</ul>
<p>In ShES, there is no variable for ‘Paidwk’ (Paid work in last 7
days). Need to find a variable that indicates employment or not.<br>
The variables the data does have include:<br>
- nssec3<br>
- nssec8<br>
- nactiv/econact - equivalent of activity status</p>
<p>Not done yet, but need to think through the best variables to include
to accurately represent econonic/activity status.</p>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="whether-working-in-last-week">Whether working in last week<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#whether-working-in-last-week"></a>
</h5>
<p>This variable was called ‘Nactiv’ in SheS08; the wording of the
question changed slightly in 2009 but the name was kept the same as in
2008 by mistake. In SHeS10, this variable changed to
<code>Nactiv09</code>.</p>
<p>There is also another variable: econac08 - the economic status of
respondent.<br>
- 1: In education<br>
- 2: In paid employment, self-employed, or on government training<br>
- 3: perm unable to work<br>
- 4: Looking for/intending to look for paid work<br>
- 5: Retired<br>
- 6: Looking after home/family<br>
- 7: Doing something else.</p>
<p>In 2012, econac08 changed to econac12, but kept the same responses.
We use econac08/econac12 to represent the economic status of the
respondent.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="education">Education<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#education"></a>
</h3>
<p>The main education variable produced by the function
<code><a href="../reference/clean_education.html">clean_education()</a></code> is a four category description of the age
at which someone finished full-time education. The categories are:<br>
- never went to school,<br>
- left at 15 years or younger,<br>
- left at 16-18,<br>
- left at 19 years or over.</p>
<p>If someone was still in full time education at the time of the
survey, then if they were younger than 18 years, we assumed they would
leave at 16-18, and if they were older than 18 years, we assumed they
would leave at 19 years or over.</p>
<p>A further education variable is also produced - which indicates
whether an individual reached a degree as their top qualification or
not. Here a degree is defined as an “NVQ4/NVQ5/Degree or equiv”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="family">Family<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#family"></a>
</h3>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/clean_family.html">clean_family()</a></code> processes the data on the
number of children in the household and the relationship status of each
respondent.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="number-of-children-in-the-household">Number of children in the household<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#number-of-children-in-the-household"></a>
</h4>
<p>The number of children in the household is not supplied explicitly.
There is a variable ‘hhdtypb2’ describing the household type, but it is
not explicit enough to record the number of children in the
household.</p>
<ul>
<li>Single adults household: 1 adult aged 16-64, no children,<br>
</li>
<li>Single parent household: 1 adult any age and 1 or more
children,<br>
</li>
<li>Single older household: 1 adults 65+, no children,<br>
</li>
<li>Small family: two adults of any age and one or two children,<br>
</li>
<li>Older smaller family: 1 adult under 65 and one adult 65+, or two
adults 65+ and no children<br>
</li>
<li>Large adult: 3+ adults, no children<br>
</li>
<li>Small adult: 2 adults under 65 and no children<br>
</li>
<li>Large family: 2 adults of any age and 3+ children or 3+ adults and
1+ children</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the number of children in the household is completely
missing and needs to be imputed.</p>
<p>Need to look at what is done for HSE years from 2015 onwards, as will
need to do the same with SHeS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="relationship-status">Relationship status<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#relationship-status"></a>
</h4>
<p>In previous versions of modelling (e.g. the alcohol binge model)
relationship status has been described as married/not-married. Here, we
include more detail by using:<br>
- single<br>
- married, civil partnership or cohabiting<br>
- separated, divorced, widowed</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="height-and-weight">Height and weight<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#height-and-weight"></a>
</h3>
<p>Height (cm) and weight (kg). Weight is estimated above 130kg. Missing
values of height and weight are replaced by the mean height and weight
for each age, sex and IMD quintile.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="income">Income<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#income"></a>
</h3>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/clean_income.html">clean_income()</a></code> processes the data on
income.</p>
<p>There are a few different options for classifying income - the need
to have a measure that is consistent across years of the Health Survey
for England has led us to use equivalised income quintiles only.</p>
<p>In the past a measure of in poverty / not in poverty has been used,
where the poverty threshold is defined as 60% of the median income for
any year. For years in which we only have income quintiles available, it
is not possible to make an exact calculation of poverty. But it will
coincide approximately with the lowest 2 income quintiles.</p>
<p>We keep the income variable in 5 quintiles as in the HSE. SHeS
includes individual equivalised income as well as by quintile, we
include this as variable <code>eqvinc_15</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="health-and-biometric-variables">Health and biometric variables<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#health-and-biometric-variables"></a>
</h2>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/clean_health_and_bio.html">clean_health_and_bio()</a></code> cleans data on
presence/absence of certain categories of health condition, and on
height and weight.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="health-conditions">Health conditions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#health-conditions"></a>
</h3>
<p>In line with what we do in the Health Survey for England, we include
the 14 categories of health conditions. These are:<br>
- Cancer<br>
- Endocrine or metabolic condition<br>
- Mental health condition<br>
- Nervous system condition<br>
- Eye condition<br>
- Ear condition<br>
- Heart or circulatory system condition<br>
- Respiratory condition<br>
- Digestive condition<br>
- Genito-urinary condition<br>
- Skin condition<br>
- Musculo-skeletal condition<br>
- Infectious disease<br>
- Blood and related organs condition</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="cigarette-smoking-variables">Cigarette smoking variables<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cigarette-smoking-variables"></a>
</h2>
<p>Questions about cigarette smoking have been asked of adults aged 16
and over.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="cigarette-smoking-status">Cigarette smoking status<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cigarette-smoking-status"></a>
</h3>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/smk_status.html">smk_status()</a></code> categorises cigarette smoking
into current, former and never regular cigarette smokers. If some smoke
either regularly or ocassionally, then they are classified as a current
regular cigarette smoker. People who used to smoke regularly or
ocassionally are classified as former smokers, but people who have only
tried a cigarette once or twice are classified as never smokers.
Ever-smokers are people who are either current or former smokers.</p>
<p>The only issue with using <code><a href="../reference/smk_status.html">smk_status()</a></code> for both datasets
is that SHeS does not include smoking data for children, and therefore
there are missing variables required to run the current code. May need
to create an NA column for missing variables: <code>kcigreg</code>, and
<code>kcigevr</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="former-smoking">Former smoking<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#former-smoking"></a>
</h3>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/smk_former.html">smk_former()</a></code> cleans the data on the time
since quitting and time spent as a regular smoker among former smokers.
We fill missing data:</p>
<ul>
<li>For children 8-15 years, we assume that missing values for former
smokers = 1 year.<br>
</li>
<li>For adults, we fill missing values with the average value for each
age, sex and IMD quintile subgroup.</li>
</ul>
<p>The issue with the <code><a href="../reference/smk_former.html">smk_former()</a></code> function is that in the
Health Surveys for England 2015+, time since quit and time spent as a
smoker is provided in categories rather than single years. Therefore
additional code is used for years 2015 and higher, which we don’t need
for SHeS, so will need to adapt the function for SHeS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="smoking-life-histories">Smoking life-histories<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#smoking-life-histories"></a>
</h3>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/smk_life_history.html">smk_life_history()</a></code> cleans the ages that
define when smokers started and stopped being regular cigarette smokers.
For each individual smoker, the data recorded in implies a single age at
which a smoker started to smoke and, if they stopped, an age at which
they did so. This provides a simplified view of what might be a
complicated life history of smoking, e.g. smoking to different
frequencies or levels, or starting and stopping multiple times.</p>
<p>Both the start age and stop age will have error in them e.g. due to
uncertainty in respondent recall. Start age is likely to be biased
towards earlier ages, because for adults with missing values we use the
age first tried a cigarette, and for children the variable for start age
does not necessarily mean the start of regular smoking, it is just the
age at which they started to smoke.</p>
<p>We also create a variable for the age at which an individual was
censored from our data sample - this is their age at the survey + 1
year.</p>
<p>Any missing data is assigned the average start or stop age for each
age, sex and IMD quintile.</p>
<p>The only issue with using <code><a href="../reference/smk_life_history.html">smk_life_history()</a></code> for both
datasets is that SHeS does not include smoking data for children, and
therefore there are missing variables required to run the current code.
May need to create an NA column for missing variables:
<code>kcigage</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="amount-and-type-of-cigarette-smoked-by-current-smokers">Amount and type of cigarette smoked by current smokers<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#amount-and-type-of-cigarette-smoked-by-current-smokers"></a>
</h3>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/smk_amount.html">smk_amount()</a></code> cleans the variables that
describe how much, what and to what level of addiction people smoke. The
main variable is the average number of cigarettes smoked per day. For
adults this is calculated from questions about how many cigarettes are
smoked typically on a weekday vs. a weekend. For children, this is based
on asking how many cigarettes were smoked in the last week. Missing
values are imputed as the average amount smoked for an age, sex and IMD
quintile subgroup.</p>
<p>For the HSE, we categorise cigarette preferences based on the answer
to ‘what is the main type of cigarette smoked’. In later years of the
Health Survey for England, new questions are added that ask how many
handrolled vs. machine rolled cigarettes are smoked on a weekday vs. a
weekend. We currently don’t use those questions because they were not
asked in all years.</p>
<p>We also categorise the amount smoked, and use information on the time
from waking until smoking the first cigarette. This latter variable has
a high level of missingness. Together these categorical variables allow
calculation of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3307335/" class="external-link">the
heaviness of smoking index</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="alcohol-data">Alcohol data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#alcohol-data"></a>
</h2>
<p>Alcohol consumption data in SHeS is recorded in the same ways as the
Health Survey for England (HSE), in four main forms:<br>
- How often someone usually drinks<br>
- For adults considering the last 12 months, what they drink on
average<br>
- For adults considering the last week, when they drank the most<br>
- For children considering the last week, what they drank</p>
<p>We analyse beverage-specific alcohol consumption in terms of beer
(combining normal beer, strong beer), wine (combining wine and sherry),
spirits, and alcopops.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="assumptions-about-serving-size-and-alcohol-content">Assumptions about serving size and alcohol content<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assumptions-about-serving-size-and-alcohol-content"></a>

<p>We make the same assumptions as we do in the HSE. This is described
more fully in the vignette <code>alcohol_data</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="whether-someone-drinks-and-frequency-of-drinking">Whether someone drinks and frequency of drinking<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#whether-someone-drinks-and-frequency-of-drinking"></a>
</h3>
<p>We class someone as a current drinker if they reported drinking at
all in the last 12 months e.g. even if reporting only having 1-2 drinks
a year. There is no alcohol data collected for children, therefore we
retain under 16s in our data, but assign them NAs for all alcohol
questions. Any missing data is supplemented by responses to if currently
drinks or if always non-drinker. This processing is done by the function
<code><a href="../reference/alc_drink_now_allages.html">alc_drink_now_allages()</a></code>.</p>
<p>In 2010, some of the variables are names differently to the other
years:<br>
- nberqbt7 and sberqbt are not variables - we set these variables to
zero is missing.<br>
- sberqbt is not a variable, it is called sbeer4.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="adult-average-consumption-in-the-last-12-months">Adult average consumption in the last 12 months<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adult-average-consumption-in-the-last-12-months"></a>
</h3>
<p>We estimate the average amount drunk in terms of UK standard units of
alcohol (1 unit = 10ml or 8g pure ethanol). The processing is done by
the function <code><a href="../reference/alc_weekmean_adult.html">alc_weekmean_adult()</a></code>. The calculation has the
following steps:<br>
- Convert the categorical variables to numeric variables for the
frequency with which each beverage is typically consumed (normal beer,
strong beer, spirits, sherry, wine, alcopops).<br>
- Convert the reported volumes usually consumed (e.g. small glass, large
glass) into volumes in ml, using the beverage size assumptions
above.<br>
- Combine the volumes (ml) usually consumed with the frequency of
consumption to give the average volume of each beverage type drunk each
week (assuming constant consumption across the year).<br>
- Convert the expected volumes of each beverage consumed each week to UK
standard units of alcohol consumed, using the alcohol content
assumptions above.<br>
- Collapse normal and strong beer into a single “beer” variable by
summing their units. Collapse wine and sherry into a single “wine”
variable by summing their units.<br>
- Calculate total weekly units but summing across beverage
categories.<br>
- Calculate the beverage “preference vector”, the percentage of total
consumption contributed by the consumption of each of four beverage
types (beer, wine, spirits, alcopops).<br>
- Cap the total units consumed in a week at 300 units, assuming that
above this already very high level of consumption estimates of variation
in consumption are less reliable.<br>
- Categorise average weekly consumption into “abstainer”, “lower risk”
(less than 14 units<span class="math inline">\(/\)</span>week),
“increasing risk” (greater than or equal to 14 units<span class="math inline">\(/\)</span>week and less than 35 units<span class="math inline">\(/\)</span>week for women, and less than 50

<p><code><a href="../reference/alc_sevenday_adult.html">alc_sevenday_adult()</a></code> processes the information from the
questions on drinking in the last seven days - how many times drank and
characteristics of the heaviest drinking day. We estimate the number of
UK standard units of alcohol drunk on the heaviest drinking day by using
the data on how many of what size measures of different beverages were
drunk, and combining this with our standard assumptions about beverage
volume and alcohol content. We estimate their total units on heaviest
drinking day (peakday) and categorise their binge drinking status
(did_not_drink, binge, no_binge).</p>
<p>Normally, if one of the constituent variables was missing, the whole
variable would be marked as missing. However, due to high missingness,
we just assume any missing = 0, and so are likely to make
underestimates.</p>
